### What I learned

I decided to use this project to brush up on React, which I haven't used in a while since I started using Next JS, and even though Next Js takes React as its core, there are a number of things that are done somewhat differently (as in prescriptively). Thankfully, I actually started in React when I first started learning web development, which was quite a dive into the deep end for a newbie, but thankfully I made it out alive and I think a lot of the skills I learned then helped me out a lot in learning JS as well.
