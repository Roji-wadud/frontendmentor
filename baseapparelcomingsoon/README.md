## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I learned how to use email validation and how to use custom styling. I still can't really write my own RegEx, but at least there's a bunch of expressions out there available.

One of the things I had to spend some time on was again those background SVGs that seem to trip me up every time. Anyway, seems like I'm getting better at them but I still can't say I love working with them!

### Continued development

This is a great design for a coming soon landing page, and I can see myself using this for a project soon.

### Useful resources

- [Ideas on custom styles for validation](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html5-form-validation-with-the-pattern-attribute--cms-25145) - I started with this article, which gave me some ideas on how to work out the validation styling.
- [Email validation RegEx](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php) - This is just one of the resources I looked at regarding email validation.
- [CSS grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Had to check my go-to CSS grid resource for one of my divs; I don't use grid as much as I use flexbox, but I definitely love how versatile it is. Just need to get more practice using it!
