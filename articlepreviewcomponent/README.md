## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was easier than I expected; there weren't major issues I ran into, aside from the need to add or change div containers to the HTML structure while working on the CSS. I did spend some time to experiment with possible configurations in changing the state. I don't usually use composite classes in CSS, but I did that in this case, which made it easier to work with the JS.

I did realize I left out a few things after uploading; I forgot about the box shadow and also, the image had a filter or overlay that I missed. I did try to add this afterwards; wish I had caught it earlier!
