### What I learned

I built [another version of this challenge with React](fem-introsecdropdownnav.vercel.app/) where I was trying to brush up on my React skills while testing out CUBE CSS. While I got everything working with room for improvement, I know was pretty bloated due to all the components I decided to pin in, and I also didn't take the time to refactor my JS and clean up the CSS. When I saw a lot of people submitting this challenge, I decided to try this challenge again but with just JS. I started by building out a small version on CodePen, and then I started the project with the existing HTML and some of the Sass from the React project. It took me quite a while mainly due to trying to put in new code while cleaning up my old code at the same time; this ended up being quite a good exercise in seeing what to do when you need to work with existing code and how to add new things without breaking it. I also ended up putting in all the features I had wanted to add in my React project, and I'm pretty pleased with how things turn out just using plain JS. I also wanted to add more accessiblity features, and I think that was a good try also.

Here's a short list of things I relearned/newly learned:
- CSS transitions
- Using default parameters in JS
- Using `aria-expanded` for dropdown navs and `aria-pressed` for toggling
- Building an accessible dropdown menu.

### Continued development

I might want to transform this again to another React but hopefully a cleaner one!

### Useful resources

- [Inclusive Menus & Menu Buttons](https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/) - Heydon Pickering's site was an excellent resource for me when I was trying explore how to make the site more accessible.
