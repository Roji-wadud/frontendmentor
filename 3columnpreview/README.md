## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a fairly easy challenge, and I managed to use something I newly learned, which is declaring custom properties directly in a selector (thanks to one of Kevin Powell's tutorials).

### Continued development

Not sure where I would use this yet, but I'm sure this would be good in a services section.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell: "Write SO MUCH less CSS by using custom properties like this"](https://youtu.be/Wyc2hJZ_W8o) - This helped to simplify my code a bit when styling buttons.
