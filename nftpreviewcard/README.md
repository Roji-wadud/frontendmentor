## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I mainly continued practicing CUBE CSS, and I wanted to challenge myself to see how few media queries I'd need to write. I think I only wrote one line for line height. Everything else uses `clamp()` for responsiveness.

It was fun doing the hover overlay as well, as I don't think I've done that in other FEM challenges before, only in one of my personal projects.
