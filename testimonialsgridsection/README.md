## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

This was a fairly quick and easy challenge, mainly because I've worked with CSS Grid before; this challenge was a lot easier than I thought, and the only thing I really needed to look up was how to set the grid column width in a grid template area and also the text colors for the component. I ended up checking Kevin's repo for that.

Overall, this was a nice challenge for practicing more CUBE CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's repo on learning grid](https://github.com/kevin-powell/learn-grid-the-easy-way) - I actually used this more for finding colors than for grid
- [Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://youtu.be/rg7Fvvl3taU) - This was where I found out how to set up the widths in a template; it turns out that I was just using the wrong values.
