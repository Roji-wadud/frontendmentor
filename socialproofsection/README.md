## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What I learned is that I can't always rely on what I see in the desktop and mobile views; I always need to check the files first to see what all the pieces are because I almost missed those decorative shapes again. I'm not sure why they are designed this way, in that the background is almost invisible, and if I were colorblind or had any vision issues, I would have missed them entirely.

I also learned that this kind of a component is called a social proof, which I've always called a testimonial.
