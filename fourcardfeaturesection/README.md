## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Similar to the previous challenge, I mainly tried to learn how to work faster, so I just worked on how to improve my workflow. The biggest change perhaps is just visually planning out how to structure the HTML before putting in any code.

It was also nice that I got to use custom properties within selectors to minimize the amount of code.
