### What I learned

In this challenge I tried write out all the HTML and CSS without using any old templates as a boilerplate. This is more of a refresher for me as well as an opportunity to try out CUBE CSS on a small component; I had used CUBE CSS for the first time in my previous challenge, which was one at the Junior level, and it took me some time to figure everything out. I decided to work on a Newbie challenge instead so that I can explore CUBE CSS a bit more fully. To my surprise, even without knowing the sizes of everything beforehand, writing everything was fairly quick, and styling it was even quicker. Having that said, there weren't as many changes from the mobile to desktop view as usual, and so that could have helped simplify everything. It also helped that I didn't fuss as much with the sizes as I normally do; I mainly tried to keep things to a decimal point if possible.
