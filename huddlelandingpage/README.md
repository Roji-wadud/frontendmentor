## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

This was more of a huge review of how to use SCSS with BEM. Some things I either got reminded of or learned in this process:

- One thing I need to keep in mind is to make sure to check and confirm the font size of the body before I work on the rest of the stylings, otherwise if I decide to change the font size, I might need to make a lot of other changes as well.

- I ended up changing the HTML structure and divs halfway, mainly because I failed to look at the desktop design before I started the mobile design. It would be good to do a bit more planning next time so that I wouldn't have to waste time redoing the structure.

- For the socials, I reused a component I made in another challenge, and that saved me a lot of time; plus it helped to have my memory refreshed in how I made that component.
