## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm fairly familiar with using flexbox and grid already; perhaps the one thing I didn't know prior to building this is that `justify-self` cannot be used in flexbox when `justify-items` is being used, which makes sense.

Even though I've done similar assignments before where I need to take a brief with a style sheet and build out a product, this is maybe the first time in a long while I've done it, and it took some time because I'm usually building my own projects instead of others', and it requires more attention to detail (I almost missed the box shadow under the button).

Since this is the first FM project, I decided to create this within a repo instead of having this as its own repo. I suppose having this as a standalone repo is also an option, but it's nicer to have a repo with all the FM projects in one place. It's also my first time using GitHub pages, which is what I decided on instead of the usual routes of Vercel or Netlify

### Continued development

This could be a good template for times when I'd need to build a page where products or services are being sold.
